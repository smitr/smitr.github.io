Hey there! These are few run-ins with the classics, published once or twice a week. Mostly I'm interested in whether learning dead languages can rewire our politics (this may change). If the posts ever get read it would be a good thing, and if you know of an elegant way to automate transliteration from Latin alphabet to Ancient Greek and vice-versa, please let me know.
