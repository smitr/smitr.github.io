Hey there! These are few run-ins with the classics and politics, published once
or twice a month. Mostly I'm interested in whether classics can rewire our
politics. If the posts ever get read it would be a good thing, and if you know
of an elegant way to automate transliteration from Latin alphabet to Ancient
Greek and vice-versa, please let me know\@smitrovic.
