title: Plutarch

What would we do without [Plutarch](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plutarch>)? We'd be just fine, sure. But here is a guy who wrote about virtue and politics, and lot of what he'd written two thousand years ago survived.[^2] His style isn't much, there are no brilliant passages to sigh to or quote. Yet he was loved everywhere for his writing and informed generations, rather hundreds of generations as to how to live. He was a priest,[^1] an Ancient Roman citizen, and a Greek. It probably helps his stature here in the US that Benjamin Franklin singled him out as an influence. However, I'd offer that Plutarch was onto something that runs deeper than belle letres, or erudition. He simply realized what it was that made people both responsible and effective, and at the same time good -nay best!- citizens. So, he is relevant. He is actually the most relevant of all the more I think about it, plecisely because there isn't much literary value in his texts. They aren't self-help text, though, they require some unpacking, and could use some knowledge of Plato, a little history, and above all dead languages, Ancient Greek and Latin. They are everywhere in English, especially Latin, but we lost the connection to them that existed till not that long ago.
