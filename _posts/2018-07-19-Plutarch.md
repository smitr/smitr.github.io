title: Plutarch

What would we do without [Plutarch] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plutarch)? We'd be just fine, but here is a guy who wrote about virtue and politics, and lot of what he'd written two thousand years ago - survived.[^2] His style was not much, no brilliant passages to sigh after or quote. Yet he was loved everywhere for his writing and informed generations, if not hundreds of generations as to how to live virtuous life. He was a priest,[^1] an Ancient Roman citizen, and a Greek. It probably helps his stature here in the US that Benjamin Franklin singled him out as an influence. However, I'd offer that Plutarch was onto something that runs deeper than belle letres, or erudition. He simply realized what it was that made people both responsible and effective, and at the same time good -nay best!- citizens. So, he is relevant.
