title: Plutarch

What would we do without [Plutarch](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plutarch>) ? We'd be just fine, sure. But, here is a guy who wrote about virtue and politics, and lot of what he'd written two thousand years ago survived.[^2] Now, his style isn't much, there are no brilliant passages to sigh to and recite (although he does quote others' memorable lines). Yet, he was loved everywhere for his writing and for informing generations, rather hundreds of generations, how to live. He was a priest,[^1] an Ancient Roman citizen, and a Greek. It probably helps his stature here in the US that Benjamin Franklin singled him out as an influence. However, I'd offer that Plutarch was onto something that runs deeper than belle letres or erudition. He simply realized what it was that made people both responsible and effective, and at the same time good -nay best!- citizens. So, he is relevant. He is actually more relevant the more I think about it, precisely because there isn't much literary value in his texts. They aren't self-help books, though, they require unpacking, and the reader could use some knowledge of Plato, a little history, and above all dead languages, Ancient Greek and Latin. They are all over English, especially Latin words, but we lost the connection to them, not surprisingly. It became difficult to learn them at school and their immediate value wasn't ever obvious. I think Plutarch can help get it back.
