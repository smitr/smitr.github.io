title: Plutarch

What would we do without [Plutarch](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plutarch>) ? We'd be just fine, sure. But, here is a guy who wrote about virtue and politics, and lot of what he'd written two thousand years ago survived.[^2]

Now, his style isn't much, there are no brilliant passages to sigh to and recite (although he does quote others' memorable lines and has bequethed us few adages of his own). Yet, he was loved everywhere for his writing and for informing generations, rather hundreds of generations, how to live. He was a priest,[^1] a Roman citizen, and a Greek. It benefits his stature here in the US that Benjamin Franklin singled him out as a good read. The great Macaulay described Plutarch's style as a broth "kept constantly boiling." I'd offer that Plutarch was onto something that runs deeper than belle letres, erudition, or a study of moral excellence. He simply realized what it is that makes people both responsible and effective, and at the same time good -nay best!- citizens.

So, he is relevant. Actually more relevant the more I think about it, precisely because there isn't much literary value in his texts. They aren't self-help books, though, they require unpacking, for which the reader could use some knowledge of Plato, a little history, and the dead languages, Ancient Greek and Latin. These "dead languages" are all over English, but we lost the connection to them, not surprisingly. It became difficult to make the case for learning them at schools and maintain them in curricula. Perhaps their immediate value was never obvious in a society striving for meritocracy. I think Plutarch can help bring that value back.
